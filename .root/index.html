      <p>Hi, my name is Ryan Wiseman, and I grew up in Jonesboro, AR. I served in the United States Marine Corps as an infantryman with the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, Echo Company.</p>
      <p>After completing my service, I pursued my passion for technology, earning a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Technology from Arkansas State University in 2020. I began my IT career as a Pharmacy Informatics Technician at St. Bernard's Medical Center and later transitioned to the Service Desk, where I have been honing my technical skills and supporting users ever since.</p>
      <p>I am currently focused on expanding my expertise in networking, aiming to grow professionally while leveraging my IT experience and problem-solving skills.</p>
